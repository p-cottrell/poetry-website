It is a sparkling work, presented in two parts: Conceal and Reveal.\n\n'Conceal' groups poems of self-doubt, of longing, of regret.\n\n'Reveal' answers those poems in a celebration of love, lust, and the joy of life shared and explored.\n\nAlthough these poems are engagingly joyful and immediately appealing, they repay careful reading and re-reading. This short collection announces a wonderfully skilled new poet.",
