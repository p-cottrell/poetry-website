    aboutme: "As a child, it was short stories and family newspapers (RIP ‘The Hutchinson Herald’); in my teens, it was zines and song lyrics; and as an adult, it’s a bit of everything - although I gravitate most towards poetry and creative nonfiction. \n\nWith influences including Louise Glück, Sylvia Plath, Gabrielle Bates and Hera Lindsay Bird, I like to meld lyrical and colloquial language in my own work - eschewing the mythical in favour of the achingly personal. I’m interested in poetry that springs, unexpectedly, from the mundane: from the taste of chlorine to a frayed blue jumper, or a puddle of spilled beer. \n\nPerhaps what most appeals to me about creating art from the minutiae of life is the opportunity it presents to capture something of the human condition. Every now and then, an otherwise ordinary collection of words has 'it'; a feeling of profound understanding. I intrinsically recognise this feeling in the work of my idols, and write always in pursuit of it myself."

    description: "The follow-up to her debut poetry collection, Just write about a bird sees Ellie return with a stronger, more confident poetic voice - but her desire to forage for magic in life's trivialities remains.",
    longDescription: "\"Just write about a bird.\" Such was the advice offered by one well-meaning poet to the author of this collection, as she struggled to find her footing in the local poetry scene. \n\nWhile the poet was (sort of) joking, Ellie Cottrell still found much truth in this well-worn recipe for poetic success; just write about a bird, or a flower. The trouble was, she'd never had much interest in writing about either. \n\nFrom here, the concept of Just write about a bird was born. A story told in three parts, the author invites the reader to join her as she searches for her own place in poetry. Themes of nostalgia, grief, loss, love, and hope are nestled among flights of fancy about a kid flying to the moon and becoming (briefly) a British pop star.\n\nThe follow-up to her debut poetry collection, Speakeasy, her new collection sees Cottrell return with a stronger, more confident poetic voice - but her desire to forage for magic in life's trivialities remains.",

This short collection announces a wonderfully skilled new poet.\" - In Case of Emergency Press",
