However, I've been here since June 2022, when I decided Medium was the best forum for me to vent about my experiences with bi erasure. \n\n Since then, I've written about shaving my head in winter, the time I fell into a laundry basket and broke my arm, and the night 'one quick drink' turned into a sunrise photoshoot. I've written about mosh pits, creepy men, and how great my cat is.\n\n If any of those subjects pique your interest, chuck me a follow! I can't wait to grow my account and read some great stories along the way."

This short collection announces a wonderfully skilled new poet.",
